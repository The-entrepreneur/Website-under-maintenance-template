## 📂 Project Structure

```
project-folder/
├── index.html   # Main one-page template
├── styles.css   # Styling & animations
├── script.js    # Progress bar & countdown logic
└── README.md    # You are here
```

## 🛠️ Usage

1. **Clone or download** this repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser or upload all files to your web host’s root/maintenance directory.
3. Customise:
   * **Duration** – In `script.js`, edit `TOTAL_TIME` to the number of seconds your maintenance window will last.
   * **Texts / Icons** – Update headings, paragraphs, and the icon in `index.html`.
   * **Colours / Fonts** – Tweak variables and gradients in `styles.css`.
4. That’s it! Visitors will see a friendly maintenance page until your site returns.

## ✍️ Customisation Tips

* Replace the wrench emoji by swapping `.icon-wrench::before` content in `styles.css`.
* Update the background gradient colours array in `script.js` for random palette changes.
* Add or remove sections (social links, newsletter form, etc.) as needed – everything is plain HTML.
